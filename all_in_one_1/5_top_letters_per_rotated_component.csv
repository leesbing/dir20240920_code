 It is imperative that this bill be re-introduced in order to aid female representation in political offices. Women leaders are vastly under-represented and there needs to be systematic change enacted in order to substantiate their voices.",-14.411633322600977

Rotated_Component_2,Positive,I think that women are more level headed and don't lose their temper or composure as much as men do. They are a little more professional at staying calm and together. Men tend to make snap judgements and react on them quickly while women will kind of take a step back and think about the situation a little more than a man would typically maybe.,16.928019057926043

Rotated_Component_3,Positive,"While I think that women could use training and workshops to further their careers and advance through management, I feel that women shouldn't be singled out. Everyone whether they identify as female, male, or other should have access to training that could help them improve their work situation. I also don't feel that this sort of training is the place of the government. Businesses should be encouraged to offer advancement and training to their employees and help them grow in their role at their company.

Rotated_Component_3,Positive,"I believe this bill would be beneficial to the empowerment of women in the workplace. A big issue surrounding women's rights at the moment is that women aren't equally represented in government and so it's left to men to make decisions on women's behalf. It could be seen as gender inequality to have an office of women empowerment, but the government has always supported mens rights throughout history.",18.281956879218278
